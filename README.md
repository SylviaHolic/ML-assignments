CSV File
--------
- CTG.csv contains the original data
- modifyCSV.py is used to modify CTG.csv such that columns that have only -1 and 1 as there values are removed as they are the columns that let us know the class of the vector.
- splitCSV.py should be applied on the file obtained by using "modify.csv" to generate 2 separate input files for the different classification problems involved. One problem is a 10-class classification problem whereas the other one is a 3-class classification problem.
